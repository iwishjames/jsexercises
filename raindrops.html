    <h2>Raindrops</h2>
    <p>Convert a number to a string, the contents of which depend on the number's factors.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If the number has 3 as a factor, output <span class="cH">'Pling'</span>.</li>
      <li>If the number has 5 as a factor, output <span class="cH">'Plang'</span>.</li>
      <li>If the number has 7 as a factor, output <span class="cH">'Plong'</span>.</li>
      <li>If the number does not have 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, just pass the number's digits straight through.</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>28's factors are 1, 2, 4, <strong>7</strong>, 14, 28.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Start out by getting this working with discrete functions.
    If you feel comfortable with that, try to put all your functions, collections, etc, into an object.</p>

- 28's factors are 1, 2, 4, **7**, 14, 28.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".
- 30's factors are 1, 2, **3**, **5**, 6, 10, 15, 30.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".
- 34 has four factors: 1, 2, 17, and 34.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be "34".
